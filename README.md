### App Components
	*Citybik.es API
	*MapBox API 
	*Keyword Search/Submit
	*React Map

### Technologies Being Used:
For this project, I will be using React, Node.js, and a Twitter API. 

Implementation Problems: Retrieving the info from the bike sharing api and adding it to the map.

Explanation to Solve the Problems:  The bike sharing api includes longitude and latitude, so the react map package can send that info to the mapbox component.
